      <p>
        Even first-time visitors experience a sense of familiarity when they
        arrive in Paris, with its instantly recognizable monuments, tightly
        packed bistro terraces, and chic boutiques. The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame
        Cathedral, and Louvre Museum are three attractions rarely left off any
        itinerary—and for good reason. For more, add on a Seine River cruise,
        Montmartre walking tour, Moulin Rouge dinner show, and day trip to the
        Palace of Versailles. But for all its iconic scenery and artistic
        treasures, there’s something to be said for discovering the City of
        Light like a Parisian, with leisurely visits to cafés, boulangeries, and
        the narrow alleyways of ‘arrondissements’ (neighborhoods).
